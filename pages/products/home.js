          Our Home Insurance policy offers comprehensive coverage for any
          mishaps that may occur within your home due to insured perils such as
          break-ins, fires, floods, explosions, and more. The Policy includes
          the following coverage:
          <br /> - Protection for your building: Safeguarding your property
          against loss or damage caused by perils like fire, explosions,
          lightning, storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes,
          volcanic eruptions, water tank bursts or overflows, and more.
          <br /> - Coverage for your belongings: Insuring your personal
          belongings against the aforementioned perils, as well as burglary
          (excluding theft).
          <br /> - Public liability coverage: Protecting you against any
          liability you may have towards the public.
          <br /> - Provision for personal accidents: Offering coverage for
          personal accidents that may occur within your home.
          <br /> Additionally, if your building sustains accidental damage, the
          policy provides reimbursement for the actual cost of renting a
          suitable alternative accommodation during the reinstatement period (up
          to a maximum of 12 months). The amount is capped at ten percent of the
          property&apos;s total value per year, or a proportional monthly
          portion thereof.
