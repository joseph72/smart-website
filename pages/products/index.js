                Our Motor Insurance Policy provides coverage for your legal
                liabilities towards third parties, as well as protection against
                damage to your vehicle caused by fire, theft, and other
                accidental risks. This policy is in accordance with the Motor
                Vehicles (Third party) Insurance Act (1958). There are three
                main categories of coverage available to insured individuals:
                third party damage, third party fire and theft, and
                comprehensive cover. Third Party Coverage Only This policy
                offers indemnity for you and any authorized driver in case of
                legal liability towards third parties for bodily injury, death,
                or damage to their property. The minimum limit for third-party
                property damage is currently GHÂ¢7000, but it can be increased
                upon request. Bodily injury claims will be calculated as per the
                National Insurance Commission&apos;s Limits on Motor Injury and
                Death Claims (CAP 2021). Third Party, Fire and Theft In addition
                to the standard coverage provided by Third Party Motor
                Insurance, this policy extends protection to include theft and
                fire incidents involving your vehicle. Comprehensive Coverage
                The comprehensive motor policy offers extensive coverage,
                including liability protection towards third parties, damage to
                your own vehicle, accidental collision or overturning, fire,
                external explosion, self-ignition or lightning, theft, burglary,
                house-breaking, malicious acts, flood, storm, earthquake, riot,
                strike, civil commotion, and property damage. It also covers
                injury and death to third parties for which you may be legally
                liable.
