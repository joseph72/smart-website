          The Personal Accident Policy aims to protect individuals and alleviate
          the financial burden they may face following an accident. This policy
          offers compensation in the event of death or injury, permanent total
          disablement, temporary total disablement, and medical expenses
          resulting from accidental, violent, external, and visible causes. In
          case of death, a lump sum amount is payable. The Personal Accident
          Insurance provides round-the-clock coverage, 24 hours a day, 7 days a
          week, and extends its benefits globally.
