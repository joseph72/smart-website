          <p>
            Our Motor Insurance Policy provides coverage for your legal
            liabilities towards third parties, as well as protection against
            damage to your vehicle caused by fire, theft, and other accidental
            risks. This policy is in accordance with the Motor Vehicles (Third
            party) Insurance Act (1958). There are three main categories of
            coverage available to insured individuals:
            <strong>
              Third party damage, Third party Fire and Theft, and Comprehensive
              cover.
            </strong>

                Third Party Coverage Only This policy offers indemnity for you
                and any authorized driver in case of legal liability towards
                third parties for bodily injury, death, or damage to their
                property. The minimum limit for third-party property damage is
                currently GHÂ¢7000, but it can be increased upon request. Bodily
                injury claims will be calculated as per the National Insurance
                Commission&apos;s Limits on Motor Injury and Death Claims (CAP
                2021).
