          Our Motor Insurance Policy provides coverage for your legal
          liabilities towards third parties, as well as protection against
          damage to your vehicle caused by fire, theft, and other accidental
          risks. This policy is in accordance with the Motor Vehicles (Third
          party) Insurance Act (1958). There are three main categories of
          coverage available to insured individuals: third party damage, third
          party fire and theft, and comprehensive cover. Third Party Coverage
          Only This policy offers indemnity for you and any authorized driver in
          case of legal liability towards third parties for bodily injury,
          death, or damage to their property. The minimum limit for third-party
          property damage is currently GHÂ¢7000, but it can be increased upon
          request. Bodily injury claims will be calculated as per the National
          Insurance Commission&apos;s Limits on Motor Injury and Death Claims
          (CAP 2021). Third Party, Fire and Theft In addition to the standard
          coverage provided by Third Party Motor Insurance, this policy extends
          protection to include theft and fire incidents involving your vehicle.
          Comprehensive Coverage The comprehensive motor policy offers extensive
          coverage, including liability protection towards third parties, damage
          to your own vehicle, accidental collision or overturning, fire,
          external explosion, self-ignition or lightning, theft, burglary,
          house-breaking, malicious acts, flood, storm, earthquake, riot,
          strike, civil commotion, and property damage. It also covers injury
          and death to third parties for which you may be legally liable.
